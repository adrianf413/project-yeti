# Project Yeti
This is Project Yeti, the joined efforts of Adrian Forde and Sean Harkin
to create CCPB (CryptoCurrencyPredictiveBuying). With this project we
will use coinGecko API to download real historical cryptocurrency data
and this, in conjuction with data from Reddit, will be analyzed and
attempt to create an algorithm that will buy and sell crypto currencies
at the correct time.
