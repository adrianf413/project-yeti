# Project Yeti

This is Project Yeti, the joined efforts of Adrian Forde and Sean Harkin
to create CCPB (CryptoCurrencyPredictiveBuying). 

This project will use coinGecko API to download real historical cryptocurrency data
and this, in conjuction with sentiment analysis on cryptocurrency Reddit threads 
will be used to create a trading algorithm. The algorithm's purpose will be to buy 
and sell crypto currencies at the correct time.

## CoinGecko API

## PRAW - Python Reddit API Wrapper
