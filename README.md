# Project Yeti

This is Project Yeti, the joined efforts of Adrian Forde and Sean Harkin
to create CCPB (CryptoCurrencyPredictiveBuying). 

With this project we will use coinGecko API to download real historical cryptocurrency data
and this, in conjuction with data from Reddit, will be analyzed and
attempt to create a trading algorithm that will buy and sell crypto currencies
at the correct time.

## CoinGecko API
This project uses the free coin gecko API to retreive information for the crypto currency

## PRAW - Python Reddit API Wrapper
This project uses PRAW to scrape reddit and monitor some crypto subreddits
