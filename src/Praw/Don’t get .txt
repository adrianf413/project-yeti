Top Level comment: Except the original Dr. Pepper takes an hour to wrestle open, and you cut your finger when you do (trying to extend the analogy to include transaction time/cost).

And the original Dr. Pepper is only manufactured 7 cans per second, no matter the demand.

And the original Dr. Pepper stains your shirt (open ledger, unable to hide your activity from the government, wife, business competitors).

Some of the cans of original Dr. Pepper have just water instead (Tainted coins).

Top Level comment: The irony of this post is that a lot of these are very successful businesses, and they are complete ripoffs of a legitimately good service which is arguably superior.

First, you have Dr. Pepper which is obviously Bitcoin, a fine and tasty drink but quite unhealthy if used regularly.  This photo shows a couple dozen popular BTC copies, for example Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc. (most of the pre-2015 coins).

Then you have flavors of bitcoin, like Bitcoin Cash etc. - these are your Pepsis, Mountain Dews, Orange Crush etc.

Next, you have vitamin water like EOS, XTZ, XLM - projects which claim to be a better alternative than Bitcoin, but are really still centralized or depend on a centralized body to pretend to scale.

Then you have ETH - you know what ETH is? It's water. It's what crypto is supposed to be without all of the added bullshit, like producing more CO2 than medium sized European countries. It flows through pipes without eroding them but is a powerful force over time that should not be reckoned with.

The ICOs of Ethereum are the consumers who drink it - not all good, but not all bad. You could say that ethereum developers are the athletes who use it to do amazing things.

Did I go too far in my analogy? Yes, most definitely.

P.S. Nobody will stop you from drinking soda or vitamin water but that doesn't make it good for you. Keep telling yourself it's a store of sugar while decentralized devs are over here crushing PBs.

Top Level comment: Don't get fooled.  Copies are different from forks, and this meme is purposefully trying to conflate the two to confuse people.

For Bitcoin, _the original no longer exists_.  Not one serious Bitcoin fork is the original, and for a very good reason: the original doesn't scale.

Bitcoin (aka Bitcoin Core) added RBF and Segwit and its developers are now working on LN, an external payment network that will make use of Bitcoin.  This is very far from the original.

Bitcoin Cash rolled back those soft-fork changes, and increased the block capacity (and made a few other changes to allow this to work efficiently, as well as adding a few extra features since).  This might share the same transaction history up until the fork, but is also not the original.
