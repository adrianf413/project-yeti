reply: Just relax. I can say that because when I left I was up nearly 200%. Not easy to relax when you bought in North of 11k.

Also not easy to relax when the market is a pump and dump machine for whales.

Top Level comment: I don’t know. I’m not as excited as I used to be. I see a disconnect between prices and the reality out there.

I love bitcoin. But we can’t compare bitcoin now with a $200 billion market cap to bitcoin in 2014 when it was a $6 billion market cap.

I look at transaction volume... and it hasn’t increased all that much in the past couple years.

Then the worst part is all the shitcoins. Still tens of millions of dollars for dentacoin if i remember. Then the founders of Ripple are amazingly still billionaires. I see crypto currencies like ZCash that get a guaranteed percentage of all mining, and everybody is OK with that.

Nobody is asking questions because everybody is under the assumption that prices are going to go up.

All this reminds me a lot of 1999 with the internet. You had this amazing technology, but everybody ignored valuations and actual user adoption and we know how that ended. Even the best of the best like Amazon crashed hard and everybody else went to $0.

Top Level comment: I think people need to chill, BTC is doing well. You can't expect it to skyrocket that fast without sacrificing a little bit of leverage before it hits all time high. For now I am looking at [platforms](https://www.2key.network/?utm_source=lx) that really focuses on what can be beneficial for me in the long run. Overall, we can only expect BTC, ETH and practical alt coins to survive but I suggest you hold on and just wait for this to ramp up again. This time make the right decision to be smart and don't let it get to you.

Top Level comment: BTC.  

Indecisive action today with price as we saw the lower time frame lows get swept, followed by a daily small bodied doji, the epitome of a standstill.

The monthly closed within the range of the previous monthly, also showing signs of further consolidation.

This is similar to the price action in 2016 which we saw after the big breakout. If it continues to follow the fractal we should keep consolidating for the new several weeks followed by a vicious run up for the next year or two.

Stay the course, be patient, and keep stacking sats.

The specialized coins, as well, for companies that have a great business plan. The next wave of value will probably come from real adoption and utility, if it comes at all.

Top Level comment: I feel like most Crypto investors have no idea what's going on with the market because of this fucking weird ignorance culture in every forum I visit.

People don't use technical analysis to read the charts - therefore people are lost when it comes to what the price is going to do. The culture says that TA is absurd. 

People pay too much attention to what big money is saying not what they are doing - this gives people mixed signals. Culture focuses too much on meaningless stories (Craig wright, etc).

People are too greedy and are hoping their altcoin makes them rich instead of buying BTC or ETH - this gives them a sense of dispair when things don't go their way. Culture puts priority on ALTS over BTC or ETH.

Don't follow the culture, it's toxic
